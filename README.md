# LLM Agent Gmail Parser Better RAG ðŸ“§ðŸ¤–

## Problem Addressed
Indexing emails to use with RAG applications or to extract relevant knowledge has its challenges, such as:
- A lot of noise and garbage in the text
- Dealing with email threads

## Solution
In this project, I experimented with various prompt techniques to extract the most important information from emails while addressing the problems stated above. I found that a report-style summary works better than just asking for a summary, as the latter tends to lose a lot of important information.

## Key Points ðŸŒŸ

- **Noise Reduction:** Implemented techniques to filter out irrelevant information and focus on key content.
- **Thread Handling:** Developed methods to accurately parse and summarize email threads.
- **Report-Style Summaries:** Discovered that report-style summaries retain more essential information compared to generic summaries.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Experimented with different prompt structures to enhance the extraction of valuable insights.
